*Uncover the untold stories etched into every map marker*

## Project Overview

**Histogram** is an interactive, map-driven platform that bridges geography with personal narratives. 
Users navigate a global map, uncover concise Wikipedia-based context for any location, 
and contribute their own stories and images. 
By weaving together factual data and lived experience, 
Histogram revives the hidden soul of places often overlooked in our fast-paced world.
